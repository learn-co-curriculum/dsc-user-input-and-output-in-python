# User Input and Output in Python

## Introduction

Sometimes, you'll want Python to ask users for a certain input. This is where user inputs can help!

## Objectives 

You will be able to:

* Incorporate input/output functionality in code to allow for user interaction 

## User input in Python

To get user input in Python, you can use the `input()` function. You can store the result in a variable, and use it to your heart's content. Remember that the result you get from the user will be a string, even if they enter a number.

For example, run the following cell:


```python
name = input("Give me your name: ")
print("Your name is " + name)
```

    Give me your name: Billy
    Your name is Billy


When you use the `input()` function, the program waits for the user to type something and press ENTER. Only after the user presses ENTER does the program continue.

## Manipulating strings (a few ways)

What you get from the `input()` function is always a string. What can you do with it?

First, make the string into a number. Let’s say you are 100% positive that the user entered a number. You can turn the string into an integer with the function `int()`. (Later we will see what to do when the user does NOT enter a number and you try to do this. For now, don’t worry about that problem) 

Here is what this looks like:


```python
age = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age)
print ("You are", age , "years old" )
```

    Enter your age: 43
    You are 43 years old


Unlike using `+` for string concatenation as seen earlier, we simply use a `,` for joining strings with numbers. You can also convert an `int` to `str` and use concatenation normally: 


```python
print ("You are " + str(age) + " years old")
```

    You are 43 years old


## Example
Let's create a program that asks the user to enter their name, age, and the current year. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.


```python
name = input("What is your name: ")
age = int(input("How old are you: "))
current_year = int(input("What is the current year: "))
year = str((current_year - age)+100)
print(name + " will be 100 years old in the year " + year)
```

    What is your name: Billy
    How old are you: 43
    what is the current year: 2019
    Billy will be 100 years old in the year 2076


## Summary

This lesson introduced you to character input/output and string manipulation. We also saw how we can take user input, do some basic processing and provide feedback to the user based on the input.
